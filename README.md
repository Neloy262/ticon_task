The app.py is the flask server. Before running this we have to first install yolov5 by running the following commands.

git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install

After that we need to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt of this repo. We also need to download the model weights from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IHtINbOzGtB--vfpe_euEXXmMJFdWeEy/view?usp=sharing. 
To run the server we just neeed to run the app.py file. To test the server we can run the test.py file.
